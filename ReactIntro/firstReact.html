    <!-- First, we need to tell React what kind of element we want to create, let's say an h1 tag. 
    Next, we can pass in props. We will explore this concept in more depth later, but for the 
    time being let's just pass in an empty object, via {}. Lastly, we will tell React.createElement 
    the children we want to include. That is, we need to tell React the items we want within our h1 tag. 
    This could be a string, such as "I am creating my first React component".  -->
    <!-- const myReactComponent = React.createElement("h1", {}, "I am creating my first React component") -->

    <!-- const myNestedReactComponent = React.createElement("div", {}, React.createElement("p", {}, "This element is nested")) -->
